# Info-map

## About
This application aims to store easily accessible notes you have made or want to make, by providing you with an “infinite” map together with many useful features.

## The motivation for this project

 <!-- aimthat it's an extension of your brain,
The idea of this project is that it's an extension of your brain, by having one or more map's that store notes. The map itself is “infinite" and you can place your notes wherever you like. You can structure notes by linking/referencing them to each other and make the notes look however you want. This project will also focus on how you can make- and go threw notes as efficiently as possible and by minimizing mouse clicks and overall steps to create whatever you need. With features like a quick search that brings to the note you want you can navigate quickly between every note. -->
